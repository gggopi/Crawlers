California Resources Corporation (CRC) is a company built on a solid foundation of high-quality assets, with a promising future as a newly independent oil and natural gas company. Following our spin-off from Occidental Petroleum Corporation in November 2014, CRC is California’s largest oil and natural gas producer on a gross-operated basis. CRC is focused on safely and responsibly developing conventional and unconventional assets exclusively in California while serving as responsible stewards and valued neighbors in the communities where we operate. 
We bring three competitive strengths to our mission — world-class assets, operational and financial flexibility, and an experienced board of directors and management team committed to increasing value. To capitalize on these strengths, we have implemented a value-driven capital-investment strategy focused on sustaining economic production and enhancing our net asset value, with the objective of living within our annual cash flows and reducing debt over time.

  As you are likely aware, oil and natural gas markets are in a cyclical downturn, driven largely by global supply and demand fundamentals. These factors confront CRC with the challenges of a lower price environment, but also present us with the opportunity to demonstrate our competitive advantages through the lower end of the commodity price cycle.
  We benefit from operational control of almost all of our fields and our diversified, flexible portfolio of assets. We have sufficient liquidity for our capital program and a strong asset base to operate within our cash flows, and we have a management team in place with deep experience in all phases of the energy industry cycle. We are closely monitoring market conditions and have already implemented decisive measures to adapt to this new price environment. As a result, we believe CRC is well positioned to emerge from the current commodity price downturn with a solid base for future growth.
  Our board, management team and employees share three core values — Character, Responsibility and Commitment — that define how we aspire to conduct business and interact with our stockholders, creditors, workforce, partners, regulators and communities. As we work to create and deliver value to our stockholders, we are also committed to contributing to California — because we are exclusively focused on California.
  California has suffered from a chronic energy deficit. California imports approximately 90 percent of its natural gas supply, 60 percent of its crude oil needs and 25 percent of its electricity. Nearly half of the oil used in the state is imported by supertankers from foreign countries like Saudi Arabia, Ecuador and Iraq. As a significant energy player and an economic engine in the state, we are doing our part to increase energy security, create well-paying jobs and provide royalties and tax revenues to the state. In 2014, we produced an average of 118,000 barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids, 246 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 462 gross megawatts of electricity per hour.
  The drought is a critical issue in California. Through significant investments in water conservation and recycling, we recycled approximately 79 percent of our produced water to meet our operational needs in 2014. In addition, our steamflood operations supplied a record 2 billion gallons of water for agricultural use in 2014. As a result, our company is a net water supplier to agriculture in the state, providing a greater volume for irrigation than the amount of fresh water we purchase for our statewide operations. We are committed to developing our assets in a manner that safeguards people and protects the environment. We take pride in our employees’ safety record, which is exemplary not only in the oil and gas industry, but compared to any industry sector. We seek to proactively engage with regulatory agencies, communities and other stakeholders to pursue mutually beneficial outcomes.
  All of this is made possible by our talented California workforce of more than 5,000 employees and contractors, who enable us to operate effectively and work hard to ensure that CRC consistently merits the confidence of its investors, partners and other stakeholders.
  In summary, we have an extraordinary and resilient resource base that can weather the volatility of the commodity cycle. We are proud to be one of the top oil and gas companies in the United States, producing secure and affordable energy for California by Californians. We hope you are as excited about the future as we are.
